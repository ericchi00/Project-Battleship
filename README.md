# Project-Battleship
Creating a battleship game to practice TDD based off of the Odin Project [assignment.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship)

## Technologies
Written using HTML, CSS & Javascript. Tested using Jest. 

Packages: ESLint, Prettier, Style-Loader, Jest

## Learning Outcomes
Testing makes coding a lot easier as you can stress test specific functions to ensure they are working properly. I tested the computer placing the ships over 300 times using a command line I found on stackoverflow as there was a small edge case where the ships would overlap and would only happen maybe 1/10 times. Also important to break the test to ensure the test is actually testing what you want it to test for.
